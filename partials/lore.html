    <h1>The History Of Nattura</h1>

    <h2>Antenos Dagwyr</h2>
    <p>
      There was a time before Ohn Pridos (Our First Pride) but it is only remembered in history
      as the 'Antenos Dagwyr' or Ancient Days. Small tribes scattered the land and the only means
      of keeping history was through stories by the fire. It was this time that the Spiders
      were the most dangerous group of people around.

    <h2>O'hn Pridos (0 - 350)</h2>
    <p>
      The era of O'hn came to be when the first King Protea came upon and recieved the Mana blessing
      of the World Tree. This symbolized the start of the Plant Kingdom and the first organized society
      on a large scale. Summers were long and winters seem to be over in a blink of an eye. The World
      Tree seemed to rejoice in seeing all life living and flourishing.

    <p>
      Over the next couple of years the people of the Plant Kingdom came to develop a spiritual
      connection with the World Tree and believed that it gave them strength, courage, and the
      essential force of magic in this world, Mahna, to survive. Before this time no other group
      had tried to communicate with

      Representing fellowship, spiritualist ideals, and respect for the land, the Plant Kingdom
      is considered one of the more peaceful societies in Nattura. They believe that they owe
      their sentient life to the World Tree, who embeds the land with Mahna and thus allowing the
      dormant life to move freely. Historically there have always been tensions between the Fungus
      Empire as well as Insect Federation because in earlier times when food was scarce, they turned
      on the Plant people for their main source of nourishment. In history the Plant Kingdom has
      faced the most hardships but the have progressed the most. The Emerald Society, located in the
      inner wall of the Emerald Gardens, is the heart of the patriarchal family that runs the
      Plant Kingdom. Each year King Protea blooms and fills the people with hope and strength while
      celebrating another year survived.

      The Spider Clan embodies strength, decisive action, and empowerment to the individual.
      Though they are given a bad rap for their less-than pleasant demeanor, the Spiders are clever,
      strong, and always have their best foot forward. Though the last to have an organized
      government, the Spider Clan are considered the most complex linguists of the world. Several
      different languages as well as universal dialects and mannerisms help the Spider Clan operate
      seperately and together when needed. Clicks and chatters that blend into the environment
      make them accomplished hunters and assassins who rule the night. It was only in the later
      years did the Spider Clan adopt the idea of having a Queen help rule so that the Spiders could
      advance along with the other forces. Though primal in their technologies, the Spiders boast
      some of the strongest mages and necromancers in the world. Their kind developed and perfected
      the dark art of necromancy but neither for good nor evil. Throughout history there have been
      many alliances between the Plant Kingdom and Spider Clan as Spiders survive on insects solely.

      The people of the Fungus Empire are considered the most loyal and determined force in Nattura.
      They believe in following their leader whole-heartedly and doing whatever they can to empower
      their vision. This leads to either great or dark times for the Empire as there have been immoral
      and reckless leaders throughout time as well as merciful and just leaders. This mostly socialist
      society believe that everybody deserves to have their basic needs met and sharing with your
      neighbor.

      The last to reach a solid form of government, the Insect Federation is founded on the ideals of
